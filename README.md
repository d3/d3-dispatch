Dispatching is a low-level interaction mechanism that allows you to register named callbacks and then call them with arbitrary arguments. A variety of D3 interaction components, such as [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag), use this mechanism to emit events to listeners. Think of this like Node’s [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html), except every listener has a well-defined name so it’s easy to remove or replace them.
